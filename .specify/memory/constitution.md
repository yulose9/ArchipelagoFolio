# WebMap Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All code MUST follow consistent style guidelines and pass static analysis. TypeScript strict mode is mandatory for type safety. ESLint and Prettier configurations are enforced via pre-commit hooks. Code complexity metrics are monitored - functions exceeding 15 lines or 3 levels of nesting require refactoring justification.

**Rationale**: Consistent, readable code reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and enables team collaboration in map feature development.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Test-Driven Development is mandatory: tests written → feature approved → tests fail → implementation. Minimum 80% code coverage required for all map rendering, geospatial calculations, and user interaction logic. Integration tests MUST cover map layer loading, coordinate transformations, and marker placement.

**Rationale**: Map applications handle complex spatial data and user interactions - comprehensive testing prevents coordinate calculation errors and ensures reliable map functionality.

### III. User Experience Consistency

UI components MUST follow established design system patterns. Map interactions (pan, zoom, marker clicks) require consistent behavior across all features. Loading states and error messages are mandatory for all asynchronous map operations. Mobile responsiveness is required for all map views with touch-optimized controls.

**Rationale**: Spatial applications require intuitive, predictable interactions - users must confidently navigate and interact with map data without interface surprises.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Map tiles MUST load within 2 seconds on 3G connections. Client-side map rendering supports minimum 60fps during pan/zoom operations. Vector layer rendering optimized for datasets up to 10,000 features. Memory usage monitored - map instances cannot exceed 100MB heap allocation.

**Rationale**: Interactive maps demand responsive performance - slow rendering or laggy interactions destroy user trust in spatial data visualization.

## Quality Gates

All features MUST pass automated testing pipeline including unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks. Code reviews require approval from at least one team member familiar with geospatial development. Performance regression testing is mandatory for map rendering and data processing components.

## Development Standards

Modern JavaScript/TypeScript with ES2022+ features for map logic. Modular architecture separating map rendering, data processing, and UI components. Consistent error handling with user-friendly messages for common map errors (network failures, invalid coordinates, unsupported formats). Documentation required for all public APIs and complex geospatial algorithms.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require documentation of impact on map functionality, approval by project maintainers, and migration plan for existing code. All pull requests MUST verify compliance with code quality, testing, UX consistency, and performance principles before merge approval.
