# Implementation Plan: Interactive 3D Map Portfolio Web App

**Branch**: `001-the-project-is` | **Date**: 2025-09-30 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/workspaces/test2/specs/001-the-project-is/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Interactive portfolio web application featuring a full-screen 3D map of the Philippines as an animated background. Users scroll through portfolio sections (About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact) layered over the map with smooth transitions and micro-animations. Built with Next.js, Mapbox GL JS, and animation libraries for performance-optimized visual experience using mock data.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript with Next.js 14+ (React-based)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Mapbox GL JS, Framer Motion, GSAP, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
**Storage**: Static content only (mock data, no persistent storage required)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop/mobile), deployed to Vercel/Netlify
**Project Type**: web - single frontend application  
**Performance Goals**: 60fps animations, <2s map tile loading, <100MB memory per map instance  
**Constraints**: Mobile responsive, lazy loading, code splitting for performance  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page portfolio, 4 main sections, demonstration/prototype scope

**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js web application with modern React architecture using App Router. Components organized by function with dedicated directories for map functionality, animations, and UI components following shadcn/ui patterns.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate setup tasks for Next.js project initialization and configuration
- Create component structure tasks based on data model (Section, MapRegion, UIComponent)
- Generate contract test tasks for each API endpoint (sections, map-regions, animation-events)
- Create integration test tasks for scroll-triggered map animations
- Generate implementation tasks following TDD principles
- Add performance optimization and deployment tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Project setup and configuration first
- Contract tests before any implementation
- Core components (Map, Sections) before advanced features (Animations)
- Mobile responsiveness after desktop implementation
- Performance optimization and deployment last
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where components are independent

**Technology-Specific Tasks**:

- Next.js App Router setup and configuration
- Mapbox GL JS integration and error handling
- Framer Motion and GSAP animation implementation
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui component styling
- TypeScript strict mode configuration and type definitions

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_
