# Research: Interactive 3D Map Portfolio Web App

## Technology Decisions

### Decision: Next.js 14+ with App Router

**Rationale**: Next.js provides excellent performance optimization features like automatic code splitting, image optimization, and server-side rendering. App Router offers modern React patterns with server components and improved routing.
**Alternatives considered**: Create React App (lacks optimization features), Vite (good but requires more manual configuration for production optimization)

### Decision: Mapbox GL JS for 3D Map Rendering

**Rationale**: Industry standard for interactive web maps with excellent 3D terrain support, smooth performance, and comprehensive API for custom interactions and animations.
**Alternatives considered**: Google Maps (limited 3D capabilities), Leaflet (2D only), Cesium (overkill for this use case)

### Decision: Framer Motion + GSAP for Animations

**Rationale**: Framer Motion provides declarative React animations with scroll-triggered animations. GSAP handles complex timeline animations and performance-critical micro-animations.
**Alternatives considered**: React Spring (less scroll integration), CSS animations only (limited control), Lottie only (requires pre-rendered animations)

### Decision: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui

**Rationale**: Tailwind provides utility-first CSS for rapid styling. shadcn/ui offers high-quality, accessible components that can be customized and maintain consistency.
**Alternatives considered**: Styled Components (runtime overhead), Material-UI (opinionated design), plain CSS (slower development)

### Decision: TypeScript Strict Mode

**Rationale**: Ensures type safety for complex map interactions and animation state management. Prevents runtime errors common in geospatial calculations.
**Alternatives considered**: JavaScript only (higher error risk), TypeScript non-strict (partial benefits)

## Integration Patterns

### Scroll-Driven Map Animations

- Use Intersection Observer API to detect section visibility
- Implement smooth map transitions with Mapbox flyTo API
- Coordinate Framer Motion scroll progress with map camera position
- Buffer animations to prevent performance issues on scroll

### Performance Optimization Strategy

- Lazy load map tiles and heavy assets
- Implement virtual scrolling for long content sections
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive calculations
- Code split animation libraries and load on demand

### Error Handling Patterns

- Graceful degradation when Mapbox fails to load
- Progressive enhancement for animation features
- Network error handling for map tile loading
- Fallback static images for critical map views

### Mobile Responsiveness Approach

- Touch-optimized map controls and gestures
- Responsive breakpoints for section layouts
- Performance considerations for mobile devices
- Battery-conscious animation patterns

## Best Practices Research

### Map Performance

- Limit simultaneous vector layers to prevent memory issues
- Use appropriate zoom levels for data complexity
- Implement tile caching strategy
- Monitor memory usage with performance API

### Animation Performance

- Use transform and opacity for hardware acceleration
- Implement will-change CSS property strategically
- Debounce scroll events to maintain 60fps
- Use requestAnimationFrame for custom animations

### Accessibility Considerations

- Keyboard navigation for map interactions
- Screen reader support for portfolio content
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Reduced motion preferences support

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions and data transformations
- Integration tests for map and animation interactions
- Visual regression tests for animation sequences
- Performance benchmarks for critical user journeys
