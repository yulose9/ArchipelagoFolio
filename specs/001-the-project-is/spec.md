# Feature Specification: Interactive 3D Map Portfolio Web App

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-project-is`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The project is a single-page interactive portfolio web application designed to deliver a visually striking and immersive experience, featuring a full-screen 3D map of the Philippines as the background, rendered with Mapbox and enhanced with smooth, performance-optimized micro-animations using libraries like Framer Motion, GSAP, or Lottie. Built with React or Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, the app presents a clean, modern interface where all UI components ‚Äî such as buttons, cards, tooltips, and sections ‚Äî animate subtly to create a refined and dynamic feel. The portfolio is structured as a scroll-based one-pager, with sections like About Me, Projects, Skills, and Contact layered over the 3D map and revealed through animated transitions that interact with the map view, such as zooming into different regions as the user scrolls. All displayed information throughout the site ‚Äî including project details, descriptions, skills, and contact text ‚Äî will use mock data, placeholder content, and Lorem Ipsum text solely for demonstration and design purposes. The entire application prioritizes smooth navigation, responsiveness, and performance, employing techniques like lazy-loading and optimized asset delivery to ensure fast load times despite the heavy visual content. By combining interactive geospatial visualization, modern animation techniques, and elegant component design with placeholder data, the web app aims to showcase creativity, technical expertise, and UI/UX sophistication in a single, highly engaging prototype experience."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts: interactive portfolio, 3D map, Mapbox, micro-animations, React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, scroll-based one-pager, animated transitions, mock data, performance optimization.
3. No major ambiguities detected; all data is placeholder/mock.
4. User scenarios and testing defined below.
5. Functional requirements generated below.
6. Key entities identified below.
7. Review checklist included.
8. Spec ready for planning.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A visitor lands on the portfolio site and is greeted by a full-screen, interactive 3D map of the Philippines. As they scroll, the map animates to zoom into different regions, and portfolio sections (About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact) are revealed with smooth transitions and animated UI components. All content is mock/demo data.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user opens the site, **When** the page loads, **Then** a 3D map of the Philippines is displayed as the animated background.
2. **Given** the user scrolls, **When** a new section is reached, **Then** the map zooms or pans to a relevant region and the section content animates in.
3. **Given** the user interacts with UI elements (buttons, cards, tooltips), **When** they hover or click, **Then** subtle micro-animations play.
4. **Given** the user is on a mobile device, **When** they interact with the site, **Then** all animations and map interactions remain smooth and responsive.
5. **Given** the site loads, **When** assets are delivered, **Then** loading is fast due to lazy-loading and optimization.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if Mapbox fails to load? ‚Üí Show fallback static map image and error message.
- How does system handle slow network? ‚Üí Show loading indicators and progressively load assets.
- What if animation libraries fail? ‚Üí UI remains functional but without enhanced animations.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a full-screen, interactive 3D map of the Philippines as the background.
- **FR-002**: System MUST animate map view (zoom/pan) in response to scroll events.
- **FR-003**: System MUST reveal portfolio sections (About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact) as overlays with animated transitions.
- **FR-004**: All UI components (buttons, cards, tooltips, sections) MUST include micro-animations for interaction feedback.
- **FR-005**: System MUST use mock/placeholder data for all displayed content.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure smooth navigation and responsiveness on all devices.
- **FR-007**: System MUST optimize asset delivery (lazy-loading, compression) for fast load times.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide fallback UI if map or animation libraries fail to load.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Section**: Represents a portfolio section (About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact); attributes: title, content, associated map region.
- **MapRegion**: Represents a region of the Philippines; attributes: name, coordinates, zoom level.
- **UIComponent**: Represents a reusable UI element (button, card, tooltip, section overlay); attributes: type, animation state, content.
